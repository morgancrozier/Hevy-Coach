## 📝 **Implementation Notes**

**Current Status**: The app is technically sophisticated but needs UX polish. The core analysis engine is excellent - focus on making insights more accessible.

**Priority Philosophy**: User experience improvements over new features. Better to have fewer features that work beautifully than many features that are hard to use.

**Development Approach**: 
1. Implement quick wins first (progressive disclosure)
2. Test with real users frequently  
3. Measure time-to-insight improvements
4. Refactor while adding features (don't accumulate technical debt)

**Next Milestone**: Transform from "powerful tool for data enthusiasts" to "delightful coaching companion for all fitness levels" 🎯
