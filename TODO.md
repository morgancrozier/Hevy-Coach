  - ✅ Successfully tested: correctly identified "Day 2 - Lower (Hamstring)" as next workout
  - ✅ Working exercise recommendations: Leg Press +2.5kg, Standing Leg Curls -2.5kg, etc.
  - ✅ **Documentation Updated**: README.md and comprehensive docs/CYCLICAL-ROUTINES.md created
  - ✅ **Made Completely Optional**: No hardcoded routines - uses configurable `routine_config.py`
  - ✅ **Configurable Routine Support**: Users can define any cycle (3-day, 4-day, 5-day, etc.)
